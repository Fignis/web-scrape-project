# web-scrape-project
A full stack project that will scrape listings data from various sites like Ebay using Nodejs and cheerio. I plan to use this project to further practice Reactjs on the frontend and to learn how to create a backend by possibly using Express and mongoDB.


### Planned features
 1. Web Scrapping(Nodejs, Cheerio)
    * [x] Scrape ebay listings
    * [ ] Scrape craigslist???
    * [ ] get data from multiple pages (pagination)
 2. Backend(Still choosing)
    * [ ] Make a database.
    * [ ] Connect the database.
    * [ ] Figure out how to send scrapped data to this database
 3. Frontend(Reactjs)
    * [ ] Create a search component.
    * [ ] Create a listings component.
    * [ ] Implement hooks.

### Updates

- 2/23/20 Switched from scrapping FB marketplace to another website due to the classes being to convoluted.
